With respect ot class we can achieve 0 to 100% of abstraction.abstract class can contain
non static methods with body which reduces percentage of abstraction.
TO overcome this we can go for interface by using interface we can achieve 100% of abstraction.

Points to remember:
-> we cannot create object of abstract class
-> static methods are not eligible for abstraction as we cannot override them
-> abstarct class cAN contain MAIN method and we can execute it.
-> abstract class allows non static methods with body which reduces abstraction percentage
-> static and abstract cannot used together

Private and abstract cannot be used together why?.

Because
