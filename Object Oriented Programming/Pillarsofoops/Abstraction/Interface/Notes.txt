Interface is a java component similar to class it provides 100% of abstraction and multiple inheritance.

Characteristics of Interface
-> Interface doesnot allows non static methods with body hence we can allow 100% of abstraction

->Interface doesnot allows constructor hence we can achieve mulitple inheritance.

-> Interface allows static methods with body to make functional.

-> We cannot create objects for Interface.

-> All Variables are by default public static final.

-> All methods in interface are by default public and abstract.

Inheritance with respect to interface:-
Interface to Interface we can use extends here for inheritance.

-> interface to class inheritance is possible using implements keyword
-> class to Interface is not possible in inheritance 

-> class and interface Inheritance to clas is possible but first we should inherit but first we should inherit class using extends and after we will using interface to implements.

    class A{
        public void display(){
            System.out.print("display");
        }
    }
    interface B{
        void print();
    }
    class C extends A implements B{
        public void print(){
        System.out.print("display").
        }
    }
