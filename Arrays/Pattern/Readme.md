# Array Patterns

This document covers essential array patterns commonly used in coding interviews and algorithmic problem solving:

## 1. Merge Intervals
- **Description:** Combine overlapping intervals into one.
- **Use Cases:** Calendar merging, range consolidation.

## 2. Prefix Sums
- **Description:** Precompute cumulative sums for efficient range queries.
- **Use Cases:** Subarray sum queries, difference arrays.

## 3. Sliding Window
- **Description:** Maintain a window over a subset of elements for optimal subarray processing.
- **Use Cases:** Maximum/minimum subarray, substring problems.

## 4. Two Pointers
- **Description:** Use two indices to traverse the array for efficient searching or partitioning.
- **Use Cases:** Pair finding, sorting, partitioning.

## 5. Sorting
- **Description:** Arrange elements in a specific order to simplify problem solving.
- **Use Cases:** Duplicate removal, interval merging, binary search.
