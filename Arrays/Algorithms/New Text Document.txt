This image describes key indicators for identifying problems that can be solved using the Two-Pointer Technique in algorithms:
Scenarios:
Look for problems requiring iteration through an array with two pointers, often starting from different ends or positions, to compare or manipulate elements simultaneously.
Clue:
Problem descriptions mentioning a sorted array or the need to compare elements from both ends of an array are strong indicators for this technique.
